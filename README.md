### Embed Message help
For the `embed` command, please add at least 7 lines to your message, as follows.

```
=embed Title of embed
Title URL
Description
Author
Author URL
Author Image Link
Footer
```

You might want to add fields to your embed. For every field, insert 3 lines to the bottom of your command.
```
Field Title
Field Description
Field Inline
```
Notice "Field Inline". If you set it to `true`, `y`, `yes` or `1`, it will be True. Else, it will be False. Making it True means that it can stick to other fields if applicable. This function is useless if you only have 1 field for your embed.

Inline is true for both fields
